Recursive algorithm for finding shortest route for set of nodes

Idea : Gpay's game go India!!
Suppose you want to go on holiday vacation visiting several desination , then you want to travel the shortest route covering all the desired location .
In this project i have used a recursive approach for finding the set of points in which they should be visited starting from a particular location

These are the mentioned location to visit , starting point and their ending point .
using geocoder library i had found the latitude and longitude of each location
and either by python library or by havershine algorithm/ formula we can calculate the shortest distance between those points .

Using Recursive approach for finding shortest route and plotting those coordinate using folium .

Note* - Starting and Ending location should be different  , keeping them same would lead this problem similar to travelling sales men problem.
